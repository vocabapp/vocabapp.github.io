            <h3>General</h3>
            <p>These Terms of Use constitute a legally binding agreement made between you, whether personally or on
                behalf of an entity ("you") and Vocab ("Company", "we", "us", or "our"), concerning your access
                to and use of the https://vocabapp.github.io website as well as any other media form, media channel,
                mobile website or mobile application related, linked, or otherwise connected thereto (collectively, the
                "Site"). You agree that by accessing the Site, you have read, understood, and agreed to be bound by all
                of these Terms of Use. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH ALL OF THESE TERMS OF USE, THEN YOU ARE EXPRESSLY
                PROHIBITED FROM USING THE SITE AND YOU MUST DISCONTINUE USE IMMEDIATELY.</p>
            <p>Supplemental terms and conditions or documents that may be posted on the Site from time to time are
                hereby expressly incorporated herein by reference. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to make
                changes or modifications to these Terms of Use at any time and for any reason. We will alert you about
                any changes by updating the "Last updated" date of these Terms of Use, and you waive any right to
                receive specific notice of each such change. It is your responsibility to periodically review these
                Terms of Use to stay informed of updates. You will be subject to, and will be deemed to have been made
                aware of and to have accepted, the changes in any revised Terms of Use by your continued use of the Site
                after the date such revised Terms of Use are posted.</p>

                in any jurisdiction or country where such distribution or use would be contrary to law or regulation or
                which would subject us to any registration requirement within such jurisdiction or country. Accordingly,
                those persons who choose to access the Site from other locations do so on their own initiative and are
                solely responsible for compliance with local laws, if and to the extent local laws are applicable.</p>

            <h3>Subscriptions</h3>
            <p>Certain elements and features of the Services are free, but we charge for some features of the Services
                and reserve the right to charge for certain additional Services in the future. We will notify you before
                any Services you are then using begin carrying a fee, and if you wish to continue using such Services,
                you must pay all applicable fees for such Services. Before using any portions of the Service that are
                available for a fee, you will be required to select a payment plan and provide Company information
                regarding your credit card or other payment instrument. You represent and warrant to Company that such
                information is true and that you are authorized to use the payment instrument. You will promptly update
                your account information with any changes (for example, a change in your billing address or credit card
                expiration date) that may occur. You agree to pay Company the amount that is specified in the payment
                plan in accordance with the terms of such plan and these Terms. You hereby authorize Company to bill
                your payment instrument in advance on a periodic basis in accordance with the terms of the applicable
                payment plan until you terminate your account, and you further agree to pay any charges so incurred. If
                you dispute any charges you must let Company know within sixty (60) days after the date that Company
                charges you. We reserve the right to change Company's prices. If Company does change prices, Company
                will provide notice of the change on the site, in the Application, or in an email to you, at Company's
                option, at least 30 days before the change is to take effect. Your continued use of the Service after
                the price change becomes effective constitutes your agreement to pay the changed amount. You shall be
                responsible for all taxes associated with the Services other than U.S. taxes based on Company's net
                income.</p>
